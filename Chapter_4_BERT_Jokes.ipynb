            "This couple go to an agricultural show way out in the countryside a fine Sunday afternoon and are watching the auctioning off of bulls. The guy selling the bulls announces the first bull to be auctioned off, \"A fine specimen, this bull reproduced 60 times last year.\"The wife nudges her husband in the ribs and comments, \"See! That was more than 5 times a month!\" The second bull is to be sold, \"Another fine specimen, this wonder reproduced 120 times last year.\" Again the wife bugs her husband, \"Hey, that's some 5 times a month. What do you say to that?\" Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison. The third bull is up for sale, \"And this extraordinary specimen reproduced 365 times last year!\" The wife slaps her husband on the arm and yells, \"That's once a day, every day of the year! How about you?\" The husband was pretty irritated by now and yells back, \"Sure, once a day! Great! But, you ask the auctioneer if they were all with the same cow!\" 1\n",
